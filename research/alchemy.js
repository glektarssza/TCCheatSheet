It allows him to render physical objects into their component Essentia and recombine it again as he wishes.<br>The crucible needs to be placed over a source of constant heat and filled with water. Once the water starts boiling you simply throw any items you wish into the crucible and they will be broken down into their component Essentia.<br>If you know the proper formula and the mix of essentia within the crucible is correct, you can then drop a special item into the crucible known as a Catalist. The catalyst draws the essentia into itself and transforms into a whole new item that the crucible then ejects.<br>Any leftover Essentia remains within the crucible for further use, but it is not a good idea to leave essentia within a crucible for too long.<br>Crafting also uses some of the water within the crucible and you will eventually need to refill it. Essentia within the crucible is constantly degrading. Compound essentia degrades into one of it's component aspects, and Primal essentia simply evaporates.<br>Beyond the waste of resources, evaporating and degrading essentia can cause many strange side-effects.<br>You can empty a crucible by right clicking on it with a wand. All the essentia is dumped into the atmosphere... not something you would want to do too often."
